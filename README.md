### What I learned

In this challenge I applied the knowledge learned in Unit 3 of the training. Important concepts like
scrollable list with LazyColumn and accessing it from a data class. Also I build an expandable Card element
and, at least, I've styled the app and building using Material Theme with Jetpack Compose.

### Continued development

I will continue to learn from the Google's platform and from Jetbrain's platform Hyperskill
